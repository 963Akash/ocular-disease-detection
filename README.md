# ocular Disease Detection Website

This project is a dedicated website aimed at detecting various eye diseases by analyzing fundus images. The platform utilizes a combination of HTML and CSS for the user interface, while the backend is powered by Python, specifically leveraging Flask and TensorFlow frameworks. The primary functionality involves classifying input fundus images into eight distinct categories, encompassing both normal conditions and various abnormalities related to eye diseases.

## Features

- **Classification:** The platform categorizes fundus images into eight classes, identifying normal and abnormal conditions.
- **CNN Model:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for training and testing phases, ensuring accurate disease identification.
- **Dataset:** Relies on the ODIR dataset as the foundational resource for training and validating the model's predictive capabilities.

## Usage

To use this project locally, follow these steps:
